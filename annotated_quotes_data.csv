25,1A4Y_2,KB40Q KB40G,[hbond],"In the hRI-Ang complex, the ε-amino group of the catalytic P1 residue Lys40 (Shapiro et al., 1989) forms two hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate of Asp435 of RI (Figure 5A). In addition, the alkyl portion of the Lys40 side chain runs across the Tyr434 ring, making numerous van der Waals contacts."
26,1A4Y_2,KB40Q KB40G,[salt bridge],"The most dramatic effect of any single-site mutation was the 1300-fold weakening ofbinding due to replacement of the Ang residue Lys40 by Gln (Lee and Vallee, 1989). The magnitude of this change suggested that Lys40 forms a strong hydrogen bond with hRI, and evidence obtained by mutagenesis of hRI later identified Asp435 as its likely partner on the inhibitor (Chen and Shapiro, 1997). Thus, substitution of Asp435 by Ala decreased binding affinity to almost the same extent as the Lys40 mutation, and the complex of K40Q- Ang with D435A-RI was found to dissociate at the same rate as the complex of K40Q with native RI (Chen and Shapiro, 1997). The crystal structure reveals that there are in fact two salt bridges between the ε-amino group of Lys40 and the carboxylate of Asp435 (Table IV, Figure 5A)."

29,1A4Y_2,RB5A,[hbond],"This change can again be explained by the loss of interactions with the C-terminal region of RI: the crystal structure shows two hydrogen bonds between the guanidino group of Arg5 and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Trp438 on RI (Table IV, Figure 5B)."
32,1A4Y_2,HB8A,[hbond],"More modest effects accompanied mutations of RI Ser460 and its hydrogen-bonding partners on Ang, His8 and Gln12.  The 8.5-fold increase in Ki for the des(460) RI derivative seems to be due largely to removal of the interaction of Ser460 with His8 rather than with Gln12, based on the relative changes produced by substituting these residues individually by Ala (4.6- and 1.6-fold, respectively)."
34,1A4Y_2,WB89A,[hbond],"Trp318 and Trp375 effectively envelop Pro88 of Ang, making a total of 15 van der Waals contacts.

In the barnase-barstar complex, the side-chain of Hisl02bn interacts with three barstar residues: the NE2 atom of Hisl02bn forms a hydrogen bond with Asp39*, ND1 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Gly31b*, and the His side-chain interacts face-to-edge with the aromatic ring of Tyr29b* (Figure 2). The single mutations Hisl02bn --+ Ala and Tyr29b* ~ Ala result in a loss of 6.1 kcal tool -1 and 3.4 kcal mo1-1 binding energ34 respectivel~ Interestingl~ the mutation Tyr29b* --, Phe does not destabilise the complex, despite the two hydrogen bonds of the OH group of Tyr29b* with the carbonyl groups of Asn83bn andAsn84bn: a possible explanation could be that the hydrogen bond angles are not favourable (Buckle et al., 1994)."

84,1BRS,RA59K RA59A,[hbond],"The mutant complexes lacked the hydrogen bonds related to the mutational sites, but still kept the rest of the hydrogen bonds; a hydrogen bond between Ng2 nitrogen atom of bn-Arg59 and Od1 oxygen atom of bs-Asp35 was lacked only in the complexes bn (Q2A)-bs (D35A), while ahydrogen bond between Ng1 nitrogen atom of bn-Arg59 and Oe1 oxygen atom of bs-Glu76 was lacked only in the complex bn (wt)-bs (E76A).At the edge of the interface, Arg59bn forms hydrogen bonds with Asp35b* and Glu76b*, and packs closely against the aromatic ring of Trp38b*. Mutating these residues to Ala decreases the binding energy by 5.2, 4.5, 1.6 and 1.4 kcal mol -~, respectively."
85,1BRS,EA60A,[electrostatic],"Schreiber and Fersht (1993a) found three barnase mutants that have even higher association rate constants with barstar, Asp-Ala54, Glu-Ala73, and Glu-Ala60. In these cases, k,, increases to (1.8-4.5) X lo9 s-l M-I and is approaching the theoretical diffusion-controlled rate of 7.0 X lo9 s-l M-l (Fersht, 1985). Close inspection of the sites of mutation in the structure of the complex reveals that each mutation relieves, to varying degrees, unfavorable interactions between acidicgroups of barnase and barstar.  Since the fast association rates are a direct consequence of the strong electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged surfaces of barnase and barstar,it is not surprising that the deletion of acidic groups in the barnase active site results in faster association rate constants (see Figure 5, top). …Finally, the barnase mutant Glu-Ala60 results in the largest (7.5-fold) increase in k,,. This mutation removes the unfavorable interaction with Asp35 (side chain O-.O distance -6 A) as well as the stabilizing interactions with the macrodipole and N-cap of barstar a-helix2. The stability of the complex, however, is unchanged.Note: Helix macrodipole is a cumulative effect of each residue backbone unit dipole contribution. Because helical peptides have periodic and well ordered structures, every backbone dipole vector resulted from partial charge of each atom points to approximately the same direction, as show in Fig.1, and results a macrodipole from C-terminus to N-terminus. Since this is an cumulative effect, the macrodipole (D) should be depedent to the length of the helix, i.e., the residue number (n).

The altered conformations of Tyr146 and Asn361 facilitate the formation of a hydrogen bond between the p-hydroxyl group and the carbonyl oxygen of the amide. Substitution of Asn361 by an aspartic acid residue weakens the equilibrium association constant with SGPB (marginally by a factor of 2) but strengthens the association with a-chymotrypsin by five times (Park, 1985). In the latter, this result could be due to the much stronger hydrogen bond that can be formed between the tyrosine and the aspartate carboxylate ion (cf. in OMTKYS the distance Asp171 ObZ...Tyr311 0” is very short (2.4 w in both complexes). Likewise, substitution of Asn361 by a serine residue has little effect on the equilibrium association constant with SGPB, although there is a major change in the case of a-chymotrypsin (enhanced binding by a factor of 18). We can offer no such simple explanation for this large effect unless the conformational changes upon complex formation of the two residues involved, Tyr146 and Asn361, are energetically unfavourable. Then, with the replacement of the asparagine side-chain at position 361 by the smaller serine hydroxyl group, such changes would not be required."

In thrombin, the rigid 60 loop partially occludes the active siteand hence contributes to the narrow substrate specificity (27). In MT-SP1, the loop is rotated away from the active site creating a more open cavity than in thrombin. Unlike the basic side chains of Lys60(F) in thrombin or Arg60(G) in enteropeptidase (19), the Arg60(F) side chain of MT-SP1 is directed away from the active site cleft and located between the side chains of Asp60(A) and Asp60(I).RA60cA"

The well defined 60 loop of MT-SP1 thus exhibits some capability to adapt to the rigid Kunitz-type inhibitor. In this respect it strongly differs from the also exposed but much more rigid thrombin 60 loop, which delimits the S2 cavity and normally prevents access of bulkier substrates and protein inhibitors (30).

304,1EMV,YA54A,[hydrophobic],"A consequence of this evolutionary design is that a boundary must exist between conserved and variable amino acids.

Tyr54 is able to interact with these non-conserved amino acids on the DNase by virtue of their long, hydrophobic alkyl or aromatic side-chains, with which it forms van der Waals inter- actions.

Keeble, W. Li & C.K., unpublished results), whereas a Tyr55Ala mutation diminishes binding by 4.6 kcal mol ÿ1 (Wallis et al., 1998). Since the phenyl ring makes no van der Waals contact with neighbouring residues (and the alanine substitution does not affect the confor- mational stability of Im9 itself), we interpret this loss of binding free energy as most likely due to the unfavourable exposure of the hydrophobic cavity containing Phe86 to bulk solvent."
306,1EMV,YA55A,[hydrophobic],"Interfacial Im9 alanine mutants follow the same general trend as other studies, with the greatest effects on Gbinding coming from residues that are least accessible to bulk solvent in the complex. However, Tyr55 is a notable exception to this trend. A Tyr55Ala mutation has a large effect on DNase binding energy yet a signi®cant proportion of the tyrosine side-chain is in contact with bulk solvent. This observation highlights the fact that the E9 DNase binding hotspot on Im9 is not in the centre of the protein-protein interaction surface but displaced to one side, with Tyr55 one of the outer most residues. As described earlier, the most important role of Tyr55 seems to be its capping function, excluding bulk solvent from the hydrophobic core of the interface.

346,1FSS,MB33F MB33Y MB33L MB33Q,[hydrophobic],"The most striking hydrophobic interaction is the stacking between the side chains of Met33 in FAS and Trp279 in AChE (Fig. 3b): the Sb-Ce moiety of Met33 stacks parallel to the indole ring of the tryptophan, with the sulfur atom positioned roughly above the six-membered ring and the methyl group above the five-membered ring. Although such stacking interactions are rare, they are not unknown. For instance, in AChE itself, Met83 stacks in a similar way with Trp84 in the anionic site. A search of the PDB using SPASM (GJK, unpublished program) revealed other proteins in which a methionine and a tryptophan residue interact in a similar way.

360,1GCQ,AC632G,[hbond],"Finally, to investigate the role of the n-Src loop in GrbS binding, we mutated Ala632 to glycine. Ala632 is located at the tip of the n-Src loop, and its polypeptide backbone and methyl group both closely contact the GrbS residues at the side of the valley. The mutation resulted in an affinity decrease of ~10-fold. This large decrease might be caused not only by the loss of the side chain interactions, but also by the change of the backbone conformation around Ala632 to the forms unsuitable for GrbS binding as a result of the glycine replacement."
361,1GCQ,WC637Y,[hbond],"First, since Trp637 is the major component at the bottom of the GrbS-binding valley, replacement of its side chain by a smaller one is supposed to abolish the interdomain interactions. In addition, the importance of Trp637 for supporting one of the side walls is emphasized, because it forms a hydrogen bond with the polypeptide backbone of His634 via its side chain (Figure 6A). As expected, the substitution of Trp637 for tyrosine caused a large decrease (~40-fold) in the binding af®nity."
362,1GCQ,PC657A,[hydrophobic],The large decrease (~9-fold) in the affinity caused by the Pro657Ala mutation agrees well with the tight interactions of its pyrrolidine ring with Phe165 and Tyr209 of GrbS.

The largest atomic displacement (0.5 Å) in the interface compared to WT occurs at Asp119HEL Oδ1 - an atom involved in one of the above-mentioned hydrogen bonds. In contrast to the other mutants, there are no increases in temperature factors for atoms in the vicinity of the mutation (Table 4). The calorimetric dataindicate that the unfavorable enthalpy change resulting from the loss of two interface hydrogen bonds is strongly compensated by a favorable entropy change (Table 3). This complex exhibits the largest ∆∆H, 31 kJ‚mol-1, and the largest ∆(T∆S), 20 kJ‚mol-1 , of the three mutant complexes. It is important to note that there is no space for a water molecule to insert into the interface when the OH group of Tyr101 is replaced by H. Significantly, the structure shows that the side chain of Asp119HEL is not left with its hydrogen-bonding potential unsatisfied in the mutant. Instead, Asp119HEL forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with Gln121HEL N (3.2 Å). In the WT structure, the corresponding distance is 3.8 Å, which is too long to be a hydrogen bond."
575,1KIP 1KIQ 1KIR,SA50Y,[hbond],"Summary: Hbond gets removed and replaced with water mediated h-bonds.Tyr50 of the antibody VL domain makes one direct hydrogen bond to an Asp side chain of the lysozyme antigen (FvD1.3 Tyr50 Oη‚‚‚Oδ2 Asp18HEL, 2.7 Å) and also participates in the interface water network. When VLTyr50 is mutated to Ser, this direct hydrogen bond is replaced by solvent-mediated interactions to the HEL side chain (VLSer50 Oγ‚‚‚H2O‚‚‚ H2O‚‚‚Oδ1 Asp18HEL). These two bridging water molecules occupy some of the volume that was taken up by the VLTyr50 side chain in the WT structure (Figure 5A). Several neighboring water molecules are in positions that correspond closely to those of the WT structure while others are not observed in the crystal structure probably because of the lower resolution of this structure compared to the WT crystal structure. Conformational changes in the vicinity of the mutation are largest at HEL side chains Asp18 and Asn19sthe residues that are in closest contact to VLTyr50 of FvD1.3 in the WT structure (Figure 5A)."
576,1KIP 1KIQ 1KIR,SA50Y,"[hbond],[info on adjacent contacts]","Two of the structures presented here, VLY50S and VHY32A, bound to HEL, also exhibit alterations in local solvent structure compared to WT. In both cases the solvent rearrangements are localized, and their effects do not extend far beyond the vicinity of the mutation. In VLY50S, the direct hydrogen bond to HEL in the WT structure is lost and replaced by solvent-mediated interactions (Figure 5A). A bridging water molecule substituting for a direct hydrogen bond was observed in an antibody-trisaccharide system (Bundle et al., 1994; Zdanov et al., 1994). Based on geometry criteria, namely, the hydrogen bond donor- acceptor distance and the relative orientation of the interact- ing groups, the VLY50S hydrogen bond with HEL would be classified as “strong”. However, ∆∆H for VLY50S compared to WT is only 9 kJ‚mol-1. Furthermore, as shown in Table 5, several van der Waals contacts are lost along with the hydrogen bond when VLTyr50 is substituted for Ser. Based on our analysis of the contribution of van der Waals contacts by VLTrp92 (Ysern et al., 1994), the lost contacts of Tyr50 could provide an additional ∼8 kJ‚mol-1.(Info overall relating to hydrogen bonding vs electrostatic interactions - very informative)With regard to the dielectric constant, it is pertinent that the hydrogen bonds between VHTyr101and HEL are buried in the interface of the complex while those from VLTyr50 and VHTyr32 are on the periphery (Figure 1). Thus, it is possible that the hydrogen bonds from VHTyr101 are elevated in strength compared to those from VLTyr50 and VHTyr32 due to a lower dielectric constant in the protein-protein interface compared to the periphery. However, such an effect is likely to be small since the FvD1.3-HEL interface is predominantly made up of polar residues, is highly solvated, and, therefore, should have a dielectric constant much closer to that of the solvent-exposed surface. It is unlikely that this protein-protein interface has electrostatic properties similar to that of a hydrophobic interior of a folded globular protein where the low dielectric constant would magnify the strength of hydrogen bonds."

Of these top three P1 variants, only the structure of SGPB:OMTKY3-Leu18I has been determined experimentally ~Fujinaga et al., 1982; Read et al., 1983; Huang et al., 1995!. The Leu at P1 fits beautifully into the S1 pocket of SGPB. This pocket is narrow at the top ~closest to the catalytic residue Ser195! and broadens gradually toward the bottom ~Fig. 3C!. The b-branched P1 residues are not complementary to this shape. The narrow top of the S1 pocket has to accommodate all of the atoms of the side chains ~Fig. 3!. The observed x1 angles for these b-branched residues are neither unfavourable nor unusual ~McGregor et al., 1987; Swindells et al., 1995! but the “tight fit” demands that the g-atoms of these residues point away from Pro192B-Asp194 to avoid steric clashes. In contrast, the bottom of the pocket is left relatively empty, unlike Leu18I whose side chain has van der Waals contacts with residues Gly215 and Ala192 at both sides of the S1 pocket ~Figs. 3, 4!. Cavities are rare in protein:protein recognition sites ~Janin & Chothia, 1990!, and complementarity involves close packing of the atoms between protein molecules. Eriksson et al. ~1992! have suggested that the destabi-lization of a protein in response to cavity creating mutations is directly proportional to the cavity size."

As in the case of the porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), the pocket is constricted towards its bottom by more bulky side chains of residues Val216, Vall90 and Asp226. Due to a smaller residue 213 (Ala) and due to a changed geometry of the loop 216-220, however, the entrance of the pocket seems to be more open.

782,1S0W,AC1142F,[salt bridge],"The structure of the single mutant F142A of BLIP (located at the center of C2) reveals a more complex picture (Fig. 3C). This structure shows a number of local perturbations around the mutated F142A residue. For example, TEM1 Y105 flips away from its place in C2 and takes on a new role as part of C4. Secondly, small but significant movements of both K74(BLIP) and E104(TEM1) result in an unraveling of this important salt bridge. The distance between these two residues is increased from 2.68 Å in the WT proteins to 4.45 Å in the F142A mutant (Fig. 3C). Overall, the whole organization of C2 seems to be affected by the F142A mutation.the F142A mutant structure seems to suggest that the energetic importance of F142 in stabilizing the complex is related to its role in structuring C2. The structure of the complex of TEM-WT with BLIP (F142A) provides a logical explanation for the chaotic energetic picture of this mutant, which is very much dependent on its environment"
783,1SBN,RI45K,[hbond],"The number of close contacts ( <4 A) and possible hydrogen bonds between inhibitor and enzyme was compared (Table 3). Only 117 close contacts were found for the complex between R45NOV0, compared to 135 found in WTCARL. The seven possible hydrogen bonds between main-chain atoms were equivalent in both complexes. Significant differences in the interactions with the enzyme were observed for Gly40 (P6), Pro42 (P4) and Arg48 (P3’). Gly40, engaged in 15 close contacts with the subtilisin Carlsberg residues Gly128 to Ser130 and Tyrl04, does not substantially interact with subtilisin Novo. This is a consequence of the hinge movement of eglin in the proximity of Pro42, which moves Gly40 about 1.5 A away from the enzymeThe side-chain of Arg45 points into the large cleft formed by subtilisin segments Ser125 to Pro129, Va1165 to Tyr167 and Ala152 to Asn155 (Fig. 12). Its extended conformation lies nearly parallel to the stretch of Leu126 to Gly127. Only two possible hydrogen bonds (3.2 A) between the guanidinium group of Arg45 and subtilisin Novo (main-chain oxygen atoms of Gly127 and Gly128) were found. The guanidinium group forms an additional five hydrogen bonds with highly crossconnected solvent molecules, two of which are found in subtilisin Carlsberg. Two solvent molecules found in subtilisin Carlsberg (complexed with wild-type eglin) are replaced by the side-chain of Arg45. Arg45, forms hydrogen bonds with these solvent molecules and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly127."
784,1SBN,RI45K,[hydrophobic],"The loss of these interactions is partly compensated by an increased number of interactions (20 instead of 13) of the P4 residue (Pro42) with the well-formed hydrophobic 54 pocket (Fig. 11). In particular, five additional contacts are found between Pro42 and Tyr104, which stacks on top of the pyrrolidine ring of Pro42. These hydrophobic interactions are almost as important for the reactivity of inhibitors with subtilisins as the Pl-Sl interactions (Powers et al., 1977; Hirono et al., 1984). The inhibitor segment Pro42 to Arg45 is favorably integrated as a central strand in a twisted three-stranded antiparallel P-sheet formed with the subtilisin segments Ser125 to Gly127 and GlylOO to Gly102, as was %lso observed for the complex with subtilisin Carlsberg."

Contrary to this, mutation of select hydrophobic activin A residues in the type I receptor-binding site was shown not to significantly alter Fst binding.It is possible that glutamate mutations are only detrimental to Fstl3 binding because of an unexpected electrostatic interaction. Although unlikely because each residue is buried inside the hydrophobic interface, we addressed this possibility by making the corresponding alanine mutations in both Fst and Fstl3. In agreement with the Fstl3 glutamate mutants, the Fstl3 alanine mutants are also negatively affected in ligand binding, albeit usually to a lesser degree.In both structures, an α helix pres-ents an exposed phenylalanine (F85 in BMP-RIA andF47 in FS-288), which interacts similarly with hydropho-bic residues on the ligand."

The carbonyl oxygen of this residue is hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl of Thr 131 both in wild type BHA and in the wild type 'HA '•Fab complex. In the Tl31I 'HA'•Fab complex, the Ile 131 side chain completely buries the unpaired carbonyl oxygen of HA, 156 ( the residual accessible surface area of this atom in the complex is 0.3 A2). As a consequence, no hydrogen bond is made with this carbonyl in the complex.None of the previously described direct interference mechanisms that allow mutant proteins to escape recognition by antibodies accounts for the lower affinity of the Fab for the TI 31 I mutant compared with wild-type HA. Firstly the Tl311 substitution introduces a bulkier side chain, but this is accommodated with very limited movements of other residues in the interface (Fig.3). Secondly, the loss of a hydrogen bond due to the TI311 substitution is not likely to affect the energetics of mutant HA•Fab complex formation because it occurs both in unbound mutant HA and in the mutant HA•Fab complex.IC13T should be TC131IOTHER MECHANISMS THAT CAN EXIST:"

In particular, in one case on the H2 loop of VRC-PG04, T53 shows much more sensitivity to small changes in initial conditions than most of the other cases. This case is adjacent to the G54 case discussed in detail previously, and the difficulties may be of similar origin. An additional issue is that the case cited above is experimentally determined to result in a more favorable binding affinity, despite the reduction in the size of the residue from threonine to alanine. In general, one would expect that most such cases must arise because of favorable, relatively complex rearrangements in the surrounding residues at the interface, and capturing such rearrangements is a larger sampling problem than capturing effects more localized around the target residue."
